# Your Sweater Weather

A Turing School Project created with JavaScript/JQuery (a new language in one week!). [Your Sweater Weather](https://mgoodhart5.github.io/your-sweater-weather/) is the front end portion of an API project started in Module 3. The backend I created can be found here [My Sweater Weather](https://my-sweater-weather.herokuapp.com/api/v1/forecast="Denver,Co").
